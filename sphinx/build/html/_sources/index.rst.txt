Welcome to consha's documentation!
===================================

Mission: To intelligently recommend healthy, sustainable products to conscious consumers.

consha is a free browser plugin that makes it easier for people to find healthy, sustainable alternatives of the products they purchase. The browser extension has two main features. First, it provides a green score for the product, which tells shoppers how safe the product is for them and the planet. Second, if the product is not healthy and sustainable, the user will see a list of similar recommended products from the same site that are from verified sustainable companies.

conshaâ€™s business model focuses on B2B sales where it would direct consumer traffic to a number of businesses that would support our mission statement, which is to promote healthy, sustainable products. It would generate revenue based on commissions (approximately 15%) from sales generated from directing clients to businesses. On one hand, this allows the tool to focus on giving the clients from the consumer sides free access, filters, and recommendations to healthy products. On the other hand, the commercial clients who are enlisted to have their products shown on consha as recommendations will have more direct and intelligent marketing at low cost with no initial fee.
